# Himanshi Ahir - Frontend Developer Assignment 2024

Welcome, Viewer! Please consider this document as a reference for my submitted assignment.

## Fonts

I have utilized the 'Satoshi, Sans Serif' font family for this project and statically hosted the font files in the fonts folder.

## Class Naming Convention

In every class name, I have used "bb-" prefix, which stands for Beetle Beetle. This ensures that any third-party integration cannot alter the properties of our elements, maintaining consistency and security.

## Icons

For the icons, I have generated font icons and hosted them in a local folder for seamless integration and efficient loading.

## File Minification

All `.min` extension files will be minified in the production environment to optimize performance and reduce load times.

## CSS Organization

I've structured the CSS code into sections with their respective media queries. This organization facilitates easy conversion into components, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

Feel free to explore the project and reach out for any further clarification or assistance. Thank you for your attention!

Sincerely,
